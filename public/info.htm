    <p class="tip-heading">1. Be self-empathetic</p>
    <p>
      Be as present as possible in the everyday. This is easier said than done, but 
      self-empathy thrives when we recognize what is happening in us (such as our 
      thoughts and emotions) on a regular basis. Notice what is happening to you without 
      any judgement. Self-empathy means understanding yourself, which is a crucial step 
      in being able to act empathetically toward others.
    </p>
    <p class="tip-heading">2. Observe without judgement</p>
    <p>
      Did that person cut you off on the highway out of spite, or because they were 
      rushing to an important appointment? Can you remember a time that you were so 
      caught up in a task that you forgot about everyone around you? See others’ actions 
      as simply that—actions—before jumping to conclusions about their intentions or 
      character.    
    </p>
    <p class="tip-heading">3. Listen with curiosity</p>
    <p>
      Has a friend gone through a rough time lately? You can show empathy in small 
      ways, like truly listening to their stories. Try asking questions without 
      projecting your own thoughts or experiences. Seek to understand rather than be 
      understood.    
    </p>
    <p class="tip-heading">4. Take action for others</p>
    <p>
      By interacting with this campaign, you have already taken steps to be more 
      empathetic. Taking action can be big or small: donate some money to a favorite 
      charity, call a family member and ask about their day, or read a book about 
      people unlike yourself. All of these actions show your understanding and 
      compassion.    
    </p>
    <p class="tip-heading">5. Know when to pause</p>
    <p>
      Empathy involves an emotional and psychological connection with another person. 
      While this is a beautiful strength, know that it is perfectly okay to step back 
      from empathizing. If you notice someone else repeatedly taking advantage of your 
      compassionate actions, consider pausing to evaluate your own feelings. Remember: 
      the best empathy is rooted in self-empathy.    
    </p>
    <p>
      So go forth! Observe carefully, listen closely, and act compassionately.
